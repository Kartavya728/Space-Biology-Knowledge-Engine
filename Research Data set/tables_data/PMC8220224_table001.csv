Up-regulated genes,,,
,Elovl5,fatty acid elongase,"Affiliated tissues include brain, eye and spinal cord. Related phenotypes are slow eye movements and nystagmus."
,Myoc,myocilin,Found in eye trabecular meshwork and the ciliary body. It regulates the pressure within the eye (intraocular pressure).
,Ctgf,connective tissue growth factor,"CTGF has important roles in many biological processes, including cell adhesion, tissue growth factor migration, proliferation, angiogenesis and tissue wound repair."
,"Nr4a1,4a3",retinoid receptor,Components of retinoic acid (RA) signaling pathway. Play important role in mediating eye development.
,Egr1,zinc finger protein,"Binds to the promoter region of target genes. Regulates the response to growth factors DNA damage, ischemia, cell survival, proliferation, and cell death."
,"Serpinf1, e2, h1, g1",serine protease Inhibitors,Pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF) also known as serpin F1 (SERPINF1). It influences development and differentiation of the neural retina.
,krt12,epithelial keratins,Krt12 is a specific corneal epithelial differentiation marker. It is involved in adult corneal epithelial homeostasis and wound healing response.
,Sox10,SOX10 protein,"SOX10 protein directs neural crest cells to become more specific cell types. In particular, the SOX10 protein is essential for the production of melanocytes."
,Mlph,exophilin,"This protein tethers pigment-producing melanosomes to the actin cytoskeleton in melanocytes, and is required for visible pigmentation in the hair and skin."
,Lyz2,lysozyme,Associates with the monocytemacrophase system and enhances the activity of immunoagents. Active against a range of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria.
,"Col1a1, 8a2, 12a1",alpha chains of type VIII and XII collagen,Major component of the basement membrane of the corneal endothelium.
,Rnu2-10,small nuclear RNA,Mutation of Rnu2-8 causes ataxia and neurodegeneration.
Down-regulated genes,,,
,Amy1,amylase 1,Endohydrolysis of (1â†’4)-alpha-D-glucosidic linkages in oligosaccharides and polysaccharides.
,"Krt1, Krt10",epithelial keratins,"Important constituent of nonkeratinized epithelia such as those covering the Cornea and conjunctiva, the ocular surface."
,Slc31a2,solute carrier1,Involved in low-affinity copper uptake.
,Sst,somatostatin,"Growth hormone-inhibiting hormone (GHIH), regulates the endocrine system and affects neurotransmission and cell proliferation via somatostatin receptors."
,Wisp1,WNT1,Downstream regulator in the Wnt/Frizzled-signaling pathway. Associated with cell survival.
,Azi2,5-azacytidine,Activates serine/threonine-protein kinase TBK1 and facilitates its oligomerization.
,Zfand6,AN1-Type Zinc Finger Protein,Involved in regulation of TNF-alpha induced NF-kappa-B activation and apoptosis.
,Ttc14,tetratricopeptide repeat domain 14,Maybe involved in ectoderm differentiation and neurulation.
,Asprv1,Aspartic Protease,ASPRV1 associated diseases include retinitis pigmentosa and artrichia with papular lesions.
,Wdr89,WD repeat domain 89,Plays an important role in the elongation step of protein synthesis.
,Psca,WD,Cell membrane glycoprotein. May be involved in the regulation of cell proliferation.
,Olfr613,olfactory receptor 613,G protein-coupled receptor activity
,Sbsn,suprabasin,"Oncoprotein, upregulated in multiple cancers."
,Adamts3,disintegrin,Major procollagen II N-propeptidase. A deficiency of this protein may be responsible for Dermatosparaxis
,Zfp488,zinc finger protein,function involved in transcriptional regulation.
