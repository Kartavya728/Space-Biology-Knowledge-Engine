Identifier,Recommendation
CC1,"To ensure the safety of future commercial orbital and exploration crews, quantify post-landing vertigo and orthostatic intolerance in a sufficiently large sample of returning ISS crews, as part of the immediate post-flight medical exam."
CC2,"Determine whether AG is needed as a multisystem countermeasure and whether continuous large radius AG is needed or intermittent exercise within lower-body negative pressure or short-radius AG is sufficient. Human studies in ground laboratories are essential to establish dose-response relationships, and what gravity level, gradient, rotations per minute, duration, and frequency are adequate."
CC3,Conduct studies on humans to determine whether there is an effect of gravity on micronucleation and/or intrapulmonary shunting or whether the unexpectedly low prevalence of decompression sickness on the space shuttle/ISS is due to underreporting. Conduct studies to determine operationally acceptable low suit pressure and hypobaric hypoxia limits.
CC4,Determine optimal dietary strategies for crews and food preservation strategies that will maintain bioavailability for 12 or more months.
CC5,Initiate a robust food science program focused on preserving nutrient stability for 3 or more years.
CC6,Include food and energy intake as an outcome variable in dietary intervention trials in humans.
CC7,"Conduct longitudinal studies of astronauts for cataract incidence, quality, and pathology related to radiation exposures to understand both cataract risk and radiation-induced late tissue toxicities in humans."
CC8,"Expand the use of animal studies to assess space radiation risks to humans from cancer, cataracts, cardiovascular disease, neurologic dysfunction, degenerative diseases, and acute toxicities such as fever, nausea, bone marrow suppression, and others."
CC9,"Continue ground-based cellular studies to develop end points and markers for acute and late radiation toxicities, using radiation facilities that are able to mimic space radiation exposures."
CC10,"Expand understanding of gender differences in adaptation to the spaceflight environment through flight- and ground-based research, particularly potential differences in bone, muscle, and cardiovascular function and longterm radiation risks."
CC11,Investigate the biophysical principles of thermal balance to determine whether microgravity reduces the threshold for thermal intolerance.
