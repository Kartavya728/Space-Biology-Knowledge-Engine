Lung cells,"56Fe (600 MeV/u at 0, 0.1, 0.3, 1.0 Gy) and 28Si (300 MeV/u at 0, 0.3, 1.0 Gy) high LET irradiation",Immortalized human bronchial epithelial cell line (HBEC3-KT),Global differential CpG island methylation in response to 56Fe and 28Si ion exposure suggests a lasting impact on the epigenome relevant to lung cancer,"Kennedy et al., 2018 [65]"
Hematopoietic stem cells,100 cGy of 1000 MeV/n protons (LET 0.23 keV/micron); 28Si 300 MeV/n ions (LET 70 keV/micron),Mlh1+/− mice (B6.129-Mlh1tm1Rak/NCI) representing loss of MLH1 that occurs in human hematopoietic stem cells with age,High LET 28Si ion irradiation affected hematopoietic stem cell differentiation; high LET irradiation caused early and higher incidence of tumorigenesis in Mlh1 heterozygous mice; frequent occurrence of T-cell rich B-cell (TRB) lymphomas with altered mismatch repair pathway,"Patel et al., 2020 [66]"
Spleen cells,0.5 Gy Proton irradiation (1-GeV; LET 0.24-keV/µm),Murine Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) cells-bearing C57BL/6 mice,"Upregulation of genes involved in DNA repair and cell cycle, including CDK2, MCM7, CD74, and RUVBL2","Wage et al., 2015 [67]"
Intestinal cells,56Fe-irradiation (1.6 Gy; energy-1000 MeV/nucleon; LET-148 keV/µm),Intestinal tissue from Female C57BL/6J mice,"56Fe-irradiation upregulated metabolites belonging to prostanoid biosynthesis and eicosanoid signaling pathways linked with cellular inflammation, which has been associated with intestinal inflammatory disease and colon cancer","Cheema et al., 2014 [68]"
Liver cells,56Fe ion irradiation (1 GeV/nucleon),CBA/CaJ mice,Higher incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma than γ-irradiated mice,"Weil et al., 2009 [69]"
Kidney cells,"56Fe ions irradiation (1 GeV/amu, 151 keV/μm)",Aprt heterozygous (Aprt+/−) B6D2F1 mice,Increased mutant frequencies leading to DNA damage,"Turker et al., 2017 [70]"

Normal human foreskin fibroblast cells,Kept at the International Space Station (14 days),AG1522 cells,Larger size γ-H2AX foci suggest DNA damage,"Lu et al., 2017 [72]"
Normal human foreskin fibroblast cells,Kept at the International Space Station (14 days),AG1522 cells,"Downregulation of miRNA Let-7a, which was found to be downregulated to γ ray and UV ray radiation in another study","Zhang et al., 2016 [73]"
