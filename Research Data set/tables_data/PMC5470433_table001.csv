Type of data,"Figures, Tables"
How data was acquired,"DNA-PCR, Quantitative Realtime PCR (qPCR), Sanger sequencing, Stress treatments, Photograph for plant phenotypes"
Data format,"Raw, Analyzed"
Experimental factors,SALK_084889 and Col Arabidopsis plants
Experimental features,"DNA-PCR was employed to identify the T-DNA insertion sites in SALK_084889 genome within DREB2A 3â€²UTR and LOX1 promoter region, respectively. Then SALK_084889 plants were subjected to qPCR to examine the expression levels of DREB2A and LOX1. The drought and heat responses of SALK_084889 were also performed."
