<td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><em>Atp1a2</em></td>
<td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">Integral membrane protein responsible for establishing and maintaining the electrochemical gradients of Na and K ions across the plasma membrane</td>

<td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><em>Des</em></td>
<td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">This gene encodes a muscle-specific class III intermediate filament. Homopolymers of this protein form a stable intracytoplasmic filamentous network connecting myofibrils to each other and to the plasma membrane and are essential for maintaining the strength and integrity of skeletal, cardiac and smooth muscle fibers</td>

<td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><em>Hsd3b1</em></td>
<td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">Predicted to be involved in several processes, including C21-steroid hormone metabolic process; hippocampus development; and response to corticosterone</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><em>Tpm2</em></td>
<td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">This gene encodes beta-tropomyosin, a member of the actin filament binding protein family, and mainly expressed in slow, type 1 muscle fibers</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><em>Star</em></td>
<td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">Predicted to enable cholesterol binding activity. Acts upstream of or within cellular lipid metabolic process; glucocorticoid metabolic process; and regulation of steroid biosynthetic process</td>
