Gene,Function
Atp1a2,Integral membrane protein responsible for establishing and maintaining the electrochemical gradients of Na and K ions across the plasma membrane
Des,"This gene encodes a muscle-specific class III intermediate filament. Homopolymers of this protein form a stable intracytoplasmic filamentous network connecting myofibrils to each other and to the plasma membrane and are essential for maintaining the strength and integrity of skeletal, cardiac and smooth muscle fibers"
Hsd3b1,"Predicted to be involved in several processes, including C21-steroid hormone metabolic process; hippocampus development; and response to corticosterone"
Tpm2,"This gene encodes beta-tropomyosin, a member of the actin filament binding protein family, and mainly expressed in slow, type 1 muscle fibers"
Star,Predicted to enable cholesterol binding activity. Acts upstream of or within cellular lipid metabolic process; glucocorticoid metabolic process; and regulation of steroid biosynthetic process
Akr1b7,Predicted to act upstream of or within cellular lipid metabolic process
