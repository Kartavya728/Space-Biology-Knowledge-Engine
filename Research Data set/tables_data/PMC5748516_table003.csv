Project title,Year,Performed,Principal findings,Major technical Issues,Improvements from the previous mission
TROPI-1,2006,ISS Incr. 14,A novel red-light positive phototropism identified in hypocotyls in μg,Poor-seed germination due to long storage timeCold stowage problems led to the loss of samplesMissing data due to use of videotapes,N/A (not applicable)
TROPI-2,2010,ISS Incr. 22,Red-light positive phototropism confirmed in hypocotyls in μgA novel red-light positive phototropism identified in roots in μgReduced g studies show that these red-light phototropic responses are saturated at 0.1–0.3g,Light leak discovered between rotor A and rotor B on the EMCS,Seeds were stored for less than 3 months prior to germination on ISSCold stowage procedures were improvedVideo tapes not used; rather there were direct video downlinks from ISS
Seedling Growth-1,2013,ISS Incr. 35/36,A novel blue-light positive phototropism is identified in roots in μg,None noted,Experiments were run on only one rotor of the EMCS to avoid light contamination from the other rotor
Seedling Growth-2,2014,ISS Incr. 41,Attenuation of the blue-light response occurs at 0.1–0.3gRed-light positive phototropism confirmed in hypocotyls and roots in μg,,
