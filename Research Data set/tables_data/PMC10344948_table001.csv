Celen et al.26,CERISESimulated microgravity,RNA-seq,-Simulated microgravity affects the sphingolipid signaling pathway and the longevity-regulating insulin/IGF-1 pathway-118 genes were identified as commonly differentially expressed inC. elegansexposed to either simulated microgravity or spaceflight,Detrimental effects from spaceflight are replicable in simulated microgravity and pose long-term health concerns
Sudevan et al.27,CERISEEPIGENETICSMMESimulated microgravity,Microarray,-SpaceflownC. elegansconsistently display decreasedcomt-4gene expression (a catechol-O-methyltransferase dopamine degradation enzyme),Targeting the dopamine system may be a viable and realistic therapeutic to promote safe space travel
Sun et al.28,Simulated microgravity,RNA-seq,-Multiple intestinal long non-coding RNAs were increased/decreased by simulated microgravity-Knockdown of a candidate long non-coding RNA and simulated microgravity led to the dysregulation of 43 genes,Long non-coding RNAs are involved in regulating the response to simulated microgravity
Higashitani et al.29,EPIGENETICS,Microarray,-39 genes expressed inC. elegansin response to microgravity are suppressed by the action of HDA-4,(At least some) transcriptional changes caused by microgravity are epigenetically controlled
Sun et al.30,Simulated microgravity,miRNA-Seq,"-19 miRNAs are dysregulated by exposure to simulated microgravity, many of which served to protect against the toxicity of microgravity",miRNA regulation can be protective against the negative effects of simulated microgravity
Tee et al.31,Simulated microgravity,Microarray,-1 gene was downregulated in nematode growth medium-culturedC. elegansexposed to simulated microgravity-6 genes were upregulated and 2 downregulated inC. elegansexposed to Maintenance Medium during microgravity-5 of the upregulated genes encoded non-coding RNAs,Simulated microgravity on a single generation ofC. elegansdid not induce major transcriptional changes
Gao et al.32,SZ-8,MicroarraymicroRNA microarray,-Protein phosphorylation/dephosphorylation is receptive to microgravity and space radiation-Microgravity impacts transcription depending on the dystrophin gene (dys-1)-Loss of function ofced-1(apoptotic gene) leads protective responses to space radiation,Microgravity elicits transcriptional changes inC. elegansduring short-duration spaceflight
Higashibata et al.33,CERISE,Microarray,"-Downregulation of muscle-related genes (such as the myosin heavy chains, troponins, and intermediate filaments) and metabolic genes in spaceflown samples",Gene changes reproducible across spaceflights
Zhao et al.34,SZ-8,Microarray,"-86 differentially expressed genes were identified in response to space, and were mainly related to oxidative phosphorylation","Microgravity was the main factor to induce the biological effects in the level of gene expressions, rather than space radiation"
Gao et al.35,SZ-8,MicroarraymicroRNA microarray,"-Spaceflight increased the number of differentially expressed miRNAs-Space conditions increased changes in the expression of miRNAs that may impact development, energy metabolism, apoptosis, and signaling transduction",miRNAs are likely involved in apoptosis during short-term spaceflight
Gao et al.36,SZ-8,MicroarraymicroRNA microarray,"-Double the number of transcripts were significantly altered in the spaceflight environment compared with space radiation alone-The majority of alterations were related to protein amino acid dephosphorylation and histidine metabolic and catabolic processes-cel-miR-81, cel- miR-82, cel-miR-124, and cel-miR-795 were predicted to regulate DNA damage response","Microgravity, in the presence of radiation, enhances the DNA damage response inC. elegans"
Xu et al.37,SZ-8,MicroarraymicroRNA microarray,"-23 miRNAs were altered in spaceflight-Most putative target genes of the altered miRNAs were predicted to be involved in developmental processes-cel-miR-52, -55, and −56 of the miR-51 family were sensitive to space environmental stressors",C. elegansrespond to spaceflight by altering miRNAs expression
Etheridge et al.38,CERISE,MicroarraymicroRNA,-The expression of the vast majority of microRNAs is not affected by microgravity-RNAi effectively silenced transgenic and endogenous genes in the gonad-RNAi against lysosomal protease genes prevented muscle protein degradation,RNAi works as effectively in the spaceflight environment as on Earth within multiple tissues
Selch et al.39,ICE-FIRST,Microarray,"-Normal developmental timing, apoptosis, and DNA repair transcriptional signature-Altered muscle developmenttranscriptional signature-SpaceflownC. elegansundergo a metabolic shift, which may be underlaid by insulin and/or TGF-β signaling",C. eleganscan be used to study the effects of altered gravity
Higashibata et al.40,ICE-FIRST,Microarray,-Microgravity upregulated genes related to early embryogenesis-Microgravity downregulated genes related to locomotion,"Microgravity regulates genes related to locomotion, early embryogenesis, and regeneration inC. elegans."
Higashibata et al.16,ICE-FIRST,Microarray,"-Myosin heavy chain isoforms in the body wall muscles (isoforms A & B) and the pharyngeal muscles (isoforms C & D) decreased in expression inC. elegansdeveloped in space, relative to ground controls-Expression of transcription factors controlling the expression of the myosin heavy chain isoforms was also decreased-Genes encoding troponins and tropomyosins were also decreased","C. elegansmuscle development is altered in spaceflight, which may contribute to spaceflight-induced muscle atrophy"
