ArabidopsisGene Identifier,Gene Coding Protein Description
AT1G01470,Induced in response to wounding and light stress. Might be involved in protection against desiccation.
AT1G06390,This gene is involved in response to osmotic stress. This protein can interact with the BZR1 protein involved in brassinosteroid-mediated signaling in a Y2H assay and promotes BZR1 phosphorylation in protoplasts.
AT1G05850,"Essential for tolerance to heat, salt and drought stresses. Also involved in root hair development, cell expansion and response to cytokinin."
AT1G05680,This enzyme can also transfer glycosyl groups to several compounds related to the explosive TNT when this synthetic compound is taken up from the environment.
AT1G05620,Transcript levels for this gene are elevated in older leaves suggesting that it may play a role in purine catabolism during senescence.
AT3G22370,Plays a role in shoot acclimation to low temperature. Also is capable of ameliorating reactive oxygen species production when the cytochrome pathway is inhibited.
AT5G43680,The protein is localized to the inner mitochondrial membrane that is nuclear-encoded and is essential for plant growth and development.
AT2G19620,Plays a role in dehydration stress response.
AT4G34410,Direct participation in auxin biosynthesis leading to the plantâ€™s ability to tolerate salt stress.
AT2G19620,Plays a role in dehydration stress response.
AT4G31480,"Required for plant growth, salt tolerance, and maintenance of the structure of the Golgi apparatus."
AT1G72490,"It is expressed in roots and involved in leaf root architecture, specifically the orientation of lateral root angles"
AT5G61020,Involved in cell proliferation during plant organogenesis.
AT5G45420,Plays a role in root hair elongation.
,Important role in controlling root skewing and maintaining the microtubule network.
AT4G35100,Salt-stress-inducible Major Intrinsic Protein (MIP)
AT1G13900,Encodes a dual-localized acid phosphatase (mitochondria and chloroplast) that modulates carbon metabolism.
