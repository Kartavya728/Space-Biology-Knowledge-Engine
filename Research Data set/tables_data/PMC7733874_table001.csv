Community objectives,(1) Inform space biologists of recommended guidelines for space omics experiments; (2) Enhance information exchange between space biologists at the global level; (3) Reach a more diverse community of scientists and citizen scientists; (4) Incentivize engagement toward space omics and metadata standardization in the space biology research community; (5) Invite researchers committed to these values to join our efforts
Tangible deliverables,"(1) Publish and routinely update our recommended sample-processing guidelines in a free and public repository; (2) Publish and routinely update lessons we have learned about space omics experiments in a free and public repository; (3) Upload key raw files, intermediate files, and final files using transparent and standardized data analysis pipelines for each dataset in the NASA GeneLab database; (4) Implement critical metadata standards for all datasets in the NASA GeneLab database"
Shorter-term expected impacts,"(1) Reduction in confounding factors and promotion of harmonization and interoperability between space omics datasets; (2) Increased accuracy when comparing between data, including historic spaceflight data with recently generated data, spaceflight analogue data with actual spaceflight data, and model organism data with human data; (3) Prevention of space biology researchers making the same expensive mistakes that have already been learned from other researchers; (4) Democratized access to priceless space omics data in various file formats accessible to both citizen scientists and seasoned bioinformaticians alike; (5) Accelerated derivation of valid hypotheses and novel discoveries related to the effects of space conditions on biological organisms"
Longer-term expected impacts,"(1) Improvements in hardware and software technology for future space omics experiments; (2) Advances in biological technologies, therapeutics, and countermeasures to support life in space; (3) Advances in biological technologies and therapeutics applicable to improvements of life on Earth"
