Cahill et al.12,ICE-FIRST,Microarray,"-C. eleganstranscriptional response to spaceflight demonstrates greater similarity with mouse EDL (fast-twitch muscle) compared to the soleus (slow-twitch muscle)-There was a similar increase in proliferation-related genes, cAMP signaling",C. elegansresults might be able to be extrapolated to mammalian results
Willis et al.5,Microgravity:ICE-FIRSTCERISEHypergravity,Microarray,"-Most common gene signatures between hypergravity and microgravity were similarly upregulated (ubiquitin-mediated catabolism, actin cytoskeleton regulation, cell cycle processes) or downregulated (immune system regulation)-“Metabolic regulation” displayed opposing regulation in response to hypergravity versus microgravity",Hypergravity and microgravity elicit neuronal and metabolic adaptations
Leandro et al.42,ICE-FIRST,Microarray,"-Only 6 genes were commonly downregulated inC. elegansandDrosophila melanogaster-Although, the number of genes that could be compared was reduced to only ∼20% of the comparative genome, due to ortholog-related challenges-The 6 genes were associated with metabolic and neuromuscular signaling",Very few genes are commonly regulated betweenC. elegansandDrosophila melanogasterby spaceflight
