Steps,Goals and objectives,Estimated time frame
Pre-clinical studies needed for generation of space grown cells,"• Identity: ensure that the basic identity of space grown stem cells has not significantly changed because of exposure to the space environment.• Purity: characterize the space grown stem cells to ascertain the product’s cell composition describing the proportion of stem cells and other differentiated cells.• Sterility: assess the presence of any microbial contamination such as human transmissible bacteria, fungal, known and unknow viral organisms and other adventitious agent.• Safety: determine the safety of space grown stem cells usually in-vitro to assess DNA damage, chromosomal abnormalities, tumorigenicity and in-vivo to assess toxicity, cell distribution and fate.• Potency: evaluate the functional and therapeutic effectiveness of the space grown cells that align with the intended use. This usually involves the use of in-vitro 2D or 3D cell culture system and in-vivo animal models.",3–10 years
Phase I safety clinical trial,A small study involving 5–15 patients with the targeted condition or disease to evaluate the safety of space grown stem cells.,1–2 years
Phase II efficacy clinical trial,A randomized controlled study involving 30–100 patients that shows efficacy of the space grown stem cells relative to control.,2–3 years
Phase III comparison to available treatment,A larger study comparing space grown stem cells with the best available Earth grown stem cells.,3– 4 years
Commercial licensure,Review of data and issue of a commercial licensure.,1–2 years
,Total estimated time frame,10–21 years
