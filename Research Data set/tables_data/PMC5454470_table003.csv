Animals,,
Animal model,C57Bl/6J mice,Sprague-Dawley rats
Age*,16 wk,Unspecified adults
Sex,Female,Unspecified
Body mass†,20.4,330–404
Housing,Group,Single
Methodology,,
Primary experimental method,Immunohistochemistry,Transmission electron microscopy
Specimen harvest,Postflight,"In-flight, postflight"
Counting unit,"Pre- and postsynaptic pairs, CtBP2+ synaptic ribbons",synaptic ribbons
Topographic region,"Striola, medial extrastriola",“Posterior”‡
Statistics,Linear mixed model ANOVA with bootstrap resampling,ANOVA
Outcomes,,
Principal results,Synapse density decrease (medial extrastriola),Synaptic ribbon density increase for in-flight harvested specimens
No change in total CtBP2 ribbon density; striolar ribbon densities nudged upward in microgravity,Variability in controls precluded similar conclusion for postflightday 0specimens
Interpretation,Topography-dependent plasticity associated with dynamic response heterogeneity,Spaceflight-induced ribbon density changes stable to gravity transitions of earth-return
Synaptic plasticity (density change in pre/postsynaptic components) unlikely to involve change in synaptic ribbon density,Increased ribbon density may not define increase in functional synapses
