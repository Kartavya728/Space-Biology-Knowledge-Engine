1. Wash samples in distilled H2O for four 1-h increments.
"2. Dissect samples to fit onto SEM stubs and place into SPI microporous specimen capsules (120–200 μm pore size; Structure Probe Inc., West Chester, Pennsylvania, USA)."
"3. Dehydrate in graded MeOH (10–100%, 10% intervals) at 10 min per step."
4. Plunge in LN2-cooled ethane.
5. Immediately transfer to cryovials containing either 2% OsO4in MeOH or 0.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1% tannic acid in acetone.
6. Freeze-substitution (LN2at 4°C) for 4–10 d.
"7. Perform 11 quick washes (start with MeOH in chamber; cool 10°C for CO2), followed by three infiltrating washes, leaving the final overnight."
8. Perform two additional infiltrations prior to critical point drying.
9. Critical point dry samples following manufacturer’s guidelines and transfer to dessicant-filled box.
10. Clean stubs (if necessary) with acetone sonication.
11. Mount samples on stubs with thick carbon adhesive.
12. Sputter-coat samples for 90 s in gold-palladium alloy.
13. Proceed to SEM imaging.
"Chemicals needed: water, RNAlater(for fixation; Ambion, Grand Island, New York, USA), MeOH (for dehydration), LN2, ethane, CO2. Cryovials: OsO4and MeOH, or glutaraldehyde, tannic acid, and acetone."
