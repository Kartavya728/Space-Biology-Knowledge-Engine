Higashibata et al.33,CERISE,iTRAQ,"-16 upregulated proteins, with many related to protein synthesis-43 downregulated proteins, many being cytoskeletal and metabolic proteins",Protein changes reproducible across spaceflights
Higashibata et al.41,ICE-FIRST,2D gel electrophoresis and MALDI-TOF MS,"-∼100 proteins identified-Spaceflight reduced paramyosin and aconitase expression-Spaceflight reduced the expression of troponin T, but increased the phosphorylation of troponin T",Spaceflight influenced the expression of muscle-related proteins
Higashibata et al.40,ICE-FIRST,2D gel electrophoresis,->1000 total protein spots and ∼200 phosphoprotein spots detected-10%–15% significantly increased or decreased in spaceflown samples-Several phosphoprotein spots also significantly reduced in spaceflown samples,Spaceflight impacts proteome
