Analyses started before spaceflight and continued for 6 months after landing.,Gut (fecal samples),"Confinement determined a significant degree of temporal variability in the intestinal macrobiota. Individual specificity of the microbiota compositional layout was not compromised, however some key microbial components showed conserved temporal dynamics, with potential implications for the maintenance of a health-promoting, mutualistic microbiota configuration.","At the end of the mission, a return to the initial microbiota configuration was observed only in samples from 2 subjects, while new steady states were consolidated for the other crewmembers.",16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing,Turroni et al.

Sampling began 240 days before flight to establish a baseline of microbiome variability and content.,"Gut (fecal samples), skin, nose, tongue","Spaceflight-dependent changes in the microbiome associated with the gastrointestinal tract, skin, nose, and tongue. Individual differences were observed in skin samples. The composition of the gut microbiota became more similar across astronauts in space, mostly due to a drop in the abundance of a few bacterial taxa.","Tongue: Many of the compositional changes reverted to preflight levels after the return to Earth.Nose, Gut and Skin: qualitative and quantitative changes in the microbial composition persisted for ~ 2 months in postflight samples.",16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing,Voorhies et al.
