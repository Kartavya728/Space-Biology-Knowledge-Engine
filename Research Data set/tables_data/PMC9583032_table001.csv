"Goal: To to explore routine omics collection by deciding which omics data to collect routinely, from which samples, and at which time points."
Potential topics to be addressed
""
➔ Which omic types and technologies have the highest potential for scientific return and clinical actionability (with additional consideration to multi-omic combinations)?
"➔ Which sample types are the most practical to collect (i.e., cost, sample processing procedures, and invasiveness)?"
"➔ What metadata would be the most useful and practical to standardize alongside omics collection (e.g., physiological, environmental, and lifestyle)?"
➔ At which time points should omics be collected?
➔ How can the AI readiness of the generated datasets be maximized?
