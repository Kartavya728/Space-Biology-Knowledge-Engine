Stem cell type,Duration of cell culture on the ISS (mission),Main findings,Potential applications and benefits,Study
Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs),14 days (SpaceX CRS-10),"• MSCs maintained their morphological and phenotypic characteristics.• MSCs maintained their proliferative capabilities.• Down-regulation in expression ofPLK1, suggesting µG may slow progression of MSCs at later stages of the cell cycle during longer-term culture.• MSCs maintained their differentiation capacity.• MSCs exhibited enhanced immunosuppressive capacity.• No evidence of tumorigenic transformation.",• It is feasible to grow MSC in space for human application on Earth.• MSCs expanded on the ISS could be clinically used to treat inflammatory conditions.,Huang et al.8
Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs),11 days (STS-63) and 13 days (STS-69),"• CD34+ cells maintained cell viability >95%.• Significant decrease in growth potential of multilineage, particularly erythroid, hematopoietic progenitor cells.• The decrease in progenitor cell pool is coupled to an increase in terminally differentiated macrophages.","• CD34+ cells can be expanded in space, given the right culture conditions.• µG may have direct effects on in vivo hematopoiesis during early primitive hematopoietic progenitor cell proliferation and differentiation and may be a significant component of the clinical syndrome of spaceflight anemia.",Davis et al.9
Cardiomyocytes derived from Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells (hiPSC-CMs),5.5 weeks (SpaceX CRS-9),"• hiPSC-CMs retained sarcomeric structure and morphology.• hiPSC-CMs retained contraction and relaxation velocities.• hiPSC-CMs demonstrated unchanged Ca2+ transient amplitude but showed a significant increase in transient decay tau, indicating a decreased calcium recycling rate.• Gene-expression pathways related to mitochondrial function were upregulated.• Binding motifs for transcription factors known to regulate cardiac metabolism were enriched.","• In-space hiPSC-CMs are the best model currently available for studying human cardiac function in response to microgravity at the cellular level.• Long-term cell culture of highly specialized hiPSC-CMs is possible in space.• Along with other platforms like 3D engineered heart tissues or organoids, hiPSC-CMs may enable prevention or treatment strategies to be developed for spaceflight-induced cardiac remodeling and other conditions found on Earth.",Wnorowski et al.10
Cardiac progenitor spheres derived from Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells (hiPSC-cardiac progenitors),3 weeks (SpaceX-20),"• Cardiac sphere cultures recovered beating activity 2–3 days post-flight.• Cardiac spheres were greater in size, had greater nuclei counts of live cells and contained more cells at the active phase of the cell cycle.• Cardiac spheres showed increased proliferative capacity.• Cardiac progenitor spheres were able to differentiate into highly enriched cardiomyocytes.• They had improved cellular and structural parameters, and calcium signalling.• Genes associated with cardiac development, cell cycle, proliferation, survival, and cardiac functions were upregulated.• Genes related to extracellular matrix and apoptosis were downregulated.","• Long-term spaceflight can generate enriched cardiomyocytes with improved proliferation and features.• Combination of µG and 3D culture provided a novel method to increase proliferation and differentiation of cardiac progenitors.• This study shows therapeutic application of hiPSC-CMs since therapy requires large amounts of cells with improved ability for engraftment and also cells with high quality (including improved maturation and function to improve safety of cell therapy).• Genes and pathways involved in cardiomyocyte proliferation, survival, and differentiation were analyzed, providing targets for future manipulation of these pathways.",Rampoldi et al.11
Cardiovascular progenitor cells (CPCs),12 days (SpaceX CRS-11),"• CPCs show markers of early cardiovascular development and maintain differentiation capacity.• 14 microRNAs exhibited significant changes in levels of expression in CPCs in space.• Cytoskeletal maintenance was altered in neonatal CPCs but not adult CPCs.• Genes related to mechanotransduction (YAP1, RHOA) were downregulated.• Expression of cytoskeletal genes (VIM, NES, DES, LMNB2, LMNA), non-canonical Wnt ligands (WNT5A, WNT9A), and Wnt/calcium signaling molecules (PLCG1, PRKCA) were elevated in neonatal CPCs.• Neonatal CPCs showed increased expression of genes involved in pre-mesodermal development.• Neonatal CPCs in space proliferated more rapidly than adult or ground-control CPCs.• CPCs showed increased DNA repair transcripts following spaceflight.• Stress response genes were induced in CPCs.• No transcripts associated with apoptosis were observed.• CPCs demonstrated greater migratory capacity.",• The induction of mesendodermal markers andTbxgene expression reflects potential therapeutic value of spaceflight for cardiac repair.,Baio et al.3
30 days (SpaceX CRS-11),"• Adult CPCs co-expressed several markers of early cardiovascular differentiation.• Adult CPCs expressed higher YAP1 levels in µG, especially after 12 days, but this declined at 30 days.• Adult CPCs maintained their viability and proliferative capabilities.",• Further studies defining the functional and safety implications of µG-activated cells in a model of cardiovascular repair would provide insight regarding µG-mediated conditioning in vivo.• Induction of adult CPCs to over-express YAP1 is a step towards conditioning these progenitors to have reparative potential closer to that of neonatal CPCs.,Camberos et al.12
Neural stem cells (NSCs),39.3 days,• NSCs preserved their stemness in space.• NSCs maintained their proliferative capabilities.• NSCs in space exhibited a higher metabolic state (elevated oxygen consumption and glycolysis).• NSCs maintained their ability to become neurons in the appropriate conditions.,• NSCs can be expanded in space to increase neural cell numbers and address neurodegenerative diseases.,Cepeda et al.13
