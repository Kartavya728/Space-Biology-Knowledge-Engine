Human monocytes (MM6),Fe,0.2–1.4 Gy1 Gy/min,EMSA on nuclear lysates,NF-κB DNA binding activity increased in a dose and time dependent manner,Natarajan et al. [40]
Human embryonic kidney cells (HEK 293),Ar (230 keV/µm),0.2–30 Gy,Fluorescence d2EGFP reporter gene assay,Increased NF-κB dependentd2EGFPexpression in a dose and time dependent manner,Baumstark-Khan et al. [41]
Human embryonic kidney cells (HEK 293),C (33 and 73 keV/µm),0.2–20 Gy~1 Gy/min,Fluorescence d2EGFP reporter gene assay,NF-κB dependentd2EGFPexpression was comparable to X-rays,Hellweg et al. [42]
Chinese hamster cells (V79),O,1 Gy,Western blot on whole cell lysates,"Decreased NF-κB p65 level at 30 min post irradiation, but the level recovered at longer time points",Mitra et al. [43]
Mouse Study
