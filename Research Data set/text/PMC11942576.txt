1. Introduction
Receptor-like kinases (RLKs) constitute the largest plant receptor family and are located on the cell surface to perceive and transduce a wide range of signals . By initiating intracellular signaling cascades, RLKs play pivotal roles in various molecular and cellular processes, including plant development, stress response, and signal transduction . These versatile receptors are capable of sensing plant hormones, secreted peptides, and molecules derived from pathogens involved in plant defense response . For example, RLKs recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), which trigger the Pattern-Triggered Immunity (PTI) response, activating signaling pathways that defend against pathogen invasion.
RLKs typically consist of three key domains: an extracellular domain, a transmembrane domain, and an intracellular kinase domain . The extracellular domain, characterized by significant structural diversity, forms the basis for classifying RLKs into different subclasses based on their motif structures. Among these, the proline-rich extensin-like receptor kinases (PERKs) represent a distinct group characterized by a proline-rich extracellular domain . Interestingly, while somePERKslikeBnPERK1andAtPERK4locate on the plasma membrane,AtPERK13has been demonstrated to anchor to the cell wall [6,7,8,9]. Functionally, the intracellular kinase domain of RLKs contains conserved motifs that exhibit kinase activity, which has been observed inBnPERK1andAtPERK4[7,10].
InArabidopsis thaliana, thePERKgene family consists of 15 members, some of which show specific expression patterns in roots and floral organs . However, someAtPERKgenes exhibit broad expression patterns across various tissues, such asAtPERK1,which is ubiquitously expressed, suggesting its involvement in diverse molecular and cellular processes. Recent studies have elucidated the regulation ofPERKsin response to different stress conditions . For example, the expression ofTaPERKsin wheat andGhPERKsin cotton is significantly influenced by abiotic stresses such as heat, drought, and salinity [12,13]. InA. thaliana,AtPERK13has been shown to respond to nutrient deficiencies such as phosphate, nitrogen, and iron deprivation, highlighting the role ofPERKsin maintaining nutrient homeostasis and adaptation . In rice, thePERKgene Z15 is activated by moderately low temperatures, emphasizing the adaptability ofPERKsto diverse environmental cues . Additionally,PERKshave been implicated in plant defense against pathogens. For example, the expression ofTaPERKsis influenced by fungal pathogens, andBnPERK1has been shown to respond to the pathogenSclerotinia sclerotiorum[7,12,15]. In summary,PERKsare versatile players in response to various stresses.
PERKsalso play essential roles in plant hormone signaling. Several studies have highlighted the involvement ofPERKsin the regulation of growth and development in response to hormonal signals [10,13,16]. For instance,AtPERK4has been implicated in abscisic acid (ABA) signaling during root cell elongation . Furthermore, the expression profiles ofOsPERKsandGhPERKshave shown differential expression patterns under different plant hormone treatments, including ABA, methyl jasmona (MeJA), gibberellin (GA), salicylic acid (SA), and auxin [13,16]. The intricate regulation ofPERKsby different plant hormones suggests their pivotal role in integrating hormonal signaling pathways to coordinate plant growth and stress responses.
In summary,PERKgenes are known to be critical to plant growth, development, and stress responses. Despite the essential roles ofPERKsin various processes across various plant species, comprehensive studies on thePERKgene family inBrassica napus(oilseed rape), an economically important crop serving as both an edible oil source and animal feed, are still limited . This allopolyploid species (AACC, 2n = 38), formed by the hybridization between two diploid ancestors,B. rapa(AA = 20) andB. oleracea(CC = 18), emerged approximately 6800 to 12,500 years ago . While a comprehensive study ofBrPERKgenes has been completed in male-sterileB. rapaplants, identifying 25BrPERKgenes and exploring their potential role in male sterility, studies inB. napusremain scarce .
This study aimed to provide a comprehensive study ofBnPERKgenes to include the exploration of its evolutionary history, chromosome location, and gene structure through various computational approaches. Tissue-specific and hormone treatment gene expression patterns were examined using available transcriptome datasets. Additionally, the study also investigated the role ofBnPERKsin response to the obligate pathogenPlasmodiophora brassicae,which causes clubroot disease inBrassicaspecies. By providing insights into the molecular and functional roles ofBnPERKs, this study will contribute to a deeper understanding of this often-overlooked plant receptor subfamily and its potential applications in crop improvement.
2. Results
2.1. Identification and Phylogenetic Analysis of BnPERKs in Brassica napus
FiftyPERKgenes were identified within theB. napus‘ZS11’ genome (Supplementary Tables S2 and S3). Identification was accomplished through an extensive BLAST search using 15AtPERKsequences, revealing a higher number ofBnPERKgenes compared with those reported inArabidopsis, Chinese cabbage, soybean, rice, sorghum, maize, cotton, and wheat (Supplementary Table S4). The BnPERK family of proteins exhibited varying lengths, ranging from 187 to 921 amino acids. Their molecular weights (MWs) spanned from 20.63 to 102.21 kDa, with BnPERK15C2 and BnPERK15A2 representing the extremes. Additionally, the isoelectric points (pIs) ranged from 5.26 to 8.59 (Supplementary Table S5). The data plots illustrated that BnPERK proteins exhibit a broad spectrum of MW and pI. Moreover, predictions of subcellular localization suggested that most BnPERK proteins were located on the plasma membrane and endomembrane system, while others were associated with the nucleus and chloroplast (Supplementary Table S5).
To investigate the phylogenetic distribution and evolutionary relationships of thePERKgene family, a phylogenetic tree was constructed using 50 BnPERK protein sequences and 15 AtPERK protein sequences by MEGA11 using the maximum likelihood (ML) method (Supplementary Table S6). TheBnPERKgenes were categorized into four groups (I–IV) based on sequence similarity and functional domain analysis. Group III, being the largest group, included 5 paralogs with 24BnPERKgenes. Group I followed, containing 6 paralogs with 21BnPERKgenes. Group II included 3 paralogs, with 3BnPERKgenes, while Group IV contained only 1 paralog, with 3BnPERKgenes (Figure 1). AllAtPERKgenes, with the exception ofAtPERK2, exhibited a close syntenic association with the 50BnPERKgenes. MostAtPERKgenes corresponded to 2–6 orthologous genes inB. napus, each comprising orthologous genes from both the A and C subgenomes ofB. napus. Notably,AtPERK3was associated with a single ortholog,BnPERK03A1, as its counterpart in the C subgenome appeared to have been lost. These results suggest that genome rearrangement and gene loss occurred during the polyploidization ofB. napus.

The phylogenetic tree was constructed with 50 BnPERK protein sequences and 15 AtPERK protein sequences by MEGA11 using the maximum likelihood (ML) method. A total of 15 paralogs were identified, grouped into 15 distinct clusters, each represented by a different color (PERK1 to PERK15). Based on sequence similarity and functional domain analysis, the 15 paralogs were further categorized into four major groups, which are indicated by distinct colors (outer lane). Group I, light steel blue; Group II, cornflower blue; Group III, royal blue; Group IV, black.
2.2. Chromosomal Distribution and Collinearity Analysis of BnPERK Genes
The 50BnPERKgenes were evenly distributed across the A and C subgenomes ofB. napus, with 25 genes in each (Figure 2andSupplementary Figure S1). These genes were dispersed among all chromosomes, except for A10. The highest concentration of genes was on the chromosome A1, which harbored seven genes, followed by six genes on C6 and five genes on A7. SingleBnPERKgenes were identified on chromosomes A2, A3, A4, A5, C4, and C9. The results indicated an irregular arrangement of thePERKgene family across the rapeseed chromosomes (Figure 2).

The light green boxes stand for A subgenomes and dark green boxes stand for C subgenomes inBrassica napus. The light brown lines represent collinearity inBnPERKgene pairs.
The collinear gene pairs in theB. napusgenome were analyzed to explore syntenic relationships amongBnPERKs(Figure 2). We identified 81 collinear gene pairs, including 49 pairs resulting from segmental duplication between the A and C subgenomes and 32 pairs occurring within a subgenome. The result indicated a high conservation between the A and C subgenomes. Additionally, we assessed the selective pressure exerted on duplicatedBnPERKgenes by calculating the ratios of nonsynonymous to synonymous substitutions (Ka/Ks) for the paralogous gene pairs (Supplementary Table S7). The Ka/Ks ratios ranged from 0.1409 to 0.2518 for 17 gene pairs in the A subgenome and from 0.1682 to 0.2519 for 15 gene pairs in the C subgenome. Furthermore, the Ka/Ks ratios for 49 gene pairs between the A and C subgenomes varied from 0.0482 to 0.5148. Notably, the Ka/Ks ratios for all paralogous gene pairs were found to be less than 1, indicating purifying selection acting onBnPERKgenes.
2.3. Gene Structure, Conserved Motifs, and Cis-Elements Analysis of BnPERK Genes
To elucidate the functional characteristics ofBnPERKs, the conserved motif, protein domain, and exon–intron organization were analyzed together with the phylogenetic tree (Figure 3). Ten conserved motifs were identified across the BnPERK proteins (Figure 3A andSupplementary Figure S2). These motifs exhibited consistent distribution patterns within the BnPERK proteins, with the exceptions of BnPERK15C2, BnPERK15A1, BnPERK15A3, and BnPERK10C1. Moreover, allBnPERKgenes shared conserved tyrosine kinase domains, highlighting their functional significance (Figure 3B). Exon–intron analysis revealed structural diversity within theBnPERKgene family, though orthologous genes generally shared similar gene structures (Figure 3C). MostBnPERKgenes harbored 5–9 introns, with the number of introns ranging from 3 (BnPERK15C2) to 16 (BnPERK15A2).

(C) Exon–intron analysis ofBnPERKgenes, with yellow boxes representing un-translated regions (UTRs) and orange boxes represented coding sequences (CDSs).
Cis-elements analysis is crucial for understanding gene regulation and function. Accordingly, upstream 2 kb sequences fromBnPERKstranscription start sites were analyzed (Supplementary Tables S2 and S8). The results revealed that 75% of the identifiedcis-elements were core promoter and enhancer region elements. The remainingcis-elements were associated with hormonal responses, various stresses, and developmental processes (Figure 4A andSupplementary Figure S3).Cis-elements regulated responses to diverse hormones, including methyl jasmona (MeJA), abscisic acid (ABA), gibberellin (GA), auxin, ethylene (ET), and salicylic acid (SA), which were calculated (Figure 4B). The ABA and MeJA responsive elements were abundantly detected, and the auxin responsive elements were secondarily enriched (Figure 4B). Thesecis-elements relate to various biotic and abiotic stresses, such as light, anaerobic conditions, drought, low temperature, defense, and wounds (Figure 4C). Notably, there were light-responsive elements in all of theBnPERKgenes (Supplementary Figure S3). In addition, there was a small part of thecis-elements that were categorized according to their roles in diverse developmental processes, including zein metabolism, endosperm expression, meristem expression, cell cycle regulation, and circadian control (Figure 4D). The presence of such diversecis-elements suggests potential regulatory roles ofBnPERKsin diverse biological processes.

They were categorized into four groups (A), including hormonal responses (B), biotic and abiotic stress (C), developmental processes (D), and promoter and enhancer regions, which are represented by different colors and further categorized.
2.4. Expression Pattern of BnPERK Gene Family Across Various Tissues
The expression pattern of theBnPERKgenes was analyzed across 14 tissues at various developmental stages through RNA-Seq analysis (Figure 5). The results exhibited diverse expression patterns across these tissues. There were 13 genes showing constitutive expression in multiple tissues, among whichBnPERK01A1andBnPERK01C1exhibited the highest expression levels. In contrast, certain genes displayed specific expression patterns. For example,BnPERK03A1showed highly specific but relatively low expression in the sepal, andBnPERK15A3specifically expressed in the leaf and silique. Moreover, 18 orthologous genes ofAtPERK5,AtPERK6,AtPERK7, andAtPERK12inB. napuswere highly expressed in pollen.BnPERK15C2, which encoded the shortest protein, was not expressed in any tissues, suggesting a potential loss of function. These differential expression patterns ofBnPERKgenes point to their diverse roles in plant growth and development.

The color gradient ranges from blue (indicating lower expression levels) to red (indicating higher expression levels), while the gray spots represent no detectable expression.
Furthermore, some paralogous gene pairs, such asBnPERK01A1/BnPERK01C1andBnPERK09A1/BnPERK09C1, showed similar expression patterns, being constitutively and highly expressed across all tested tissues. In contrast, other paralogous gene pairs, likeBnPERK06A1/BnPERK06A2andBnPERK06C1/BnPERK06C2, showed specific high expression in floral organs. Additionally,BnPERK15A4/BnPERK15C3showed high expression levels in different tissues, except for pollen. However, some paralogous gene pairs exhibited distinct patterns, indicating functional divergence.
2.5. Expression Pattern of BnPERK Gene Family in Response to Hormone Treatments
In order to further explore the function ofBnPERKs during hormone responses, we investigated their expression patterns in both leaves and roots after different hormone treatments (Figure 6). Among the 50 identifiedBnPERKgenes, only a small subset was expressed in leaves and roots. Most of these expressed genes were strongly induced in leaves within 0.5 h after indole acetic acid (IAA), l-aminocyclopropane-l-carboxylic acid (ACC), gibberellin acid (GA), trans-zeatin (TZ), or brassinolide (BL) treatments (Figure 6A). Additionally, four genes—BnPERK15A4,BnPERK15C3,BnPERK08A1, andBnPERK08C1—showed enhanced transcript levels at different time points after methyl jasmonate (MeJA) treatment in leaves. In contrast, their expression patterns in roots were distinct. Most genes showed enhanced expression levels after GA and ABA treatments but decreased expression levels after MeJA treatment (Figure 6B). Notably,BnPERK15A1was strongly induced after MeJA treatment. Furthermore, three genes,BnPERK09A1,BnPERK09C1, andBnPERK04C1, which showed increased expression in leaves after IAA treatment, were also induced in roots.

Different dot colors represent different relative expression levels: red dot indicates up-regulated expression, blue dot indicates down-regulated expression, and the larger the dot, the greater the fold change.
2.6. Protein–Protein Interaction Network Analysis of BnPERK Genes
Predictive interaction networks were employed to explore the biological mechanisms of BnPERK proteins. The analysis revealed that the BnPERK proteins putatively interact with 1133 proteins inB. napus. The results showed that most PERK proteins serve as core nodes in these networks, interacting with various proteins participating in different biological processes (Figure 7A andSupplementary Table S9).

Dark brown spots represent BnPERK proteins, blue spots represent proteins that interact with BnPERK proteins, and gray lines indicate the interaction between BnPERK proteins and other proteins. (B) KEGG enrichment analysis of proteins that interacted with BnPERK proteins. (C) GO enrichment analysis of proteins that interacted with BnPERK proteins.
KEGG enrichment analysis indicated that the interacting proteins were primarily involved in processes such as pentose and glucuronate interconversions, plant–pathogen interaction, starch and sucrose metabolism, cyanoamino acid metabolism, the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites, endoplasmic reticulum processing, and the MAPK signaling pathway (Figure 7B andSupplementary Table S10). Similarly, GO enrichment analysis revealed significant enrichment of terms like integral components of the membrane and plasma membrane in the cellular component category (Figure 7C andSupplementary Table S11). ATP binding and kinase activity were prominently enriched in the molecular function category. Biological process category terms such as protein phosphorylation, pectin catalytic activity, and cell wall modification were enriched. Protein interactions analysis provided a comprehensive view of the BnPERK proteins interaction network inB. napus, underscoring their central role and broad involvement in different biological processes, including sugar metabolism and plant–pathogen interaction.
2.7. Root Gall Formation and BnPERK Gene Expression in B. napus upon Plasmodiophora brassicae Inoculation
Galls were observed on the roots ofB. napusat 28 days after inoculation withP. brassicae(Figure 8A). Cross-sections of the inoculated roots revealed the changes in the vascular system. Resting spores that stained blue formed in the diseased roots. Furthermore, diseased root cells exhibited hypertrophy and disorder, accompanied by thickened cell walls, while control roots grew normally (Figure 8B). To better understand the response ofBnPERKgenes to clubroot disease, we analyzed the expression ofBnPERKat 14 days afterP. brassicaeinoculation by RNA-Seq (Figure 8C). Among the 50 identifiedBnPERKgenes, 23 were expressed in either inoculated or control roots. Notably, four genes, namelyBnPERK09A1,BnPERK09C1,BnPERK14A1, andBnPERK06C2,showed downregulated expression in response toP. brassicae, among whichBnPERK06C2was completely inhibited after inoculation. Additionally, the paralogous gene pairBnPERK09A1/BnPERK09C1also exhibited consistent expression patterns across different tissues. These four downregulatedBnPERKgenes were implicated in the response toP. brassicae.

2.8. Function of AtPERK9 in Clubroot Disease
To explore the putative role ofBnPERK09A1andBnPERK09C1in clubroot disease, the mutant of the orthologous geneAtPERK9(At1g68690) was used for clubroot disease investigation. Both the Col-0 andperk9showed disease symptoms on the main roots and the lateral roots (Figure 9A). The percentage of severely diseased plants (disease grade 3) in Col-0 was much higher than that inperk9, which resulted in a significantly higher disease index in Col-0 (Figure 9B,C). It indicated thatperk9showed decreased severity of the clubroot disease.

Furthermore, the expression levels ofPERK9,PR2,PR5,andRBOHDwere evaluated in Col-0 andperk9lines at 14 days afterP. brassicaeinoculation.PERK9also showed downregulated expression in response toP. brassicaein Col-0, while it was totally inhibited inperk9. The expressions ofPR2,PR5, andRBOHDgenes were greatly enhanced inperk9.PR2andRBOHDnot only could be induced in Col-0 afterP. brassicaeinoculation, but also inperk9. Enhanced disease resistance to clubroot disease and increased expression of these genes inperk9indicated that the basal immune response was triggered by the knockout ofPERK9.
3. Discussion
PERKs constitute a crucial subfamily of RLKs that play important roles in various molecular and cellular processes in plants, including development, signaling, and stress responses . Despite their significance, there remains a lack of comprehensive study on the molecular functions of PERKs, particularly when compared with other RLKs. While genome-wide analyses ofPERKgenes have been conducted in some species [11,12,13,16,19], a thorough study of theBnPERKgene family has yet to be published. Therefore, this study systematically analyzedBnPERKgenes, covering various aspects.
3.1. Deciphering the Evolutionary Dynamics of the BnPERK Genes
There were 50PERKgenes identified in the rapeseed cultivar ‘ZS11’ genome, highlighting an increased number ofBnPERKgenes compared with previous studies (Supplementary Table S3). This expansion ofBnPERKgenes was attributed to the evolutionary path of theBrassicagenus, which experienced a genome triplication following its divergence from theArabidopsislineage [17,18]. Through interspecific hybridization betweenB. rapa(AA) andB. oleracea(CC), the allotetraploidB. napus(AACC) arose. This complex evolutionary process contributed to the expansion of theBnPERKgene family. Studies have consistently demonstrated that whole-genome duplication and segmental duplications are crucial mechanisms driving gene duplication and the expansion of gene families [20,21,22]. The prevalence of paralogous gene pairs resulting from segmental duplication highlights the role of genome duplication events in this expansion.
Initially, it was expected that eachArabidopsisgene would have six homologs inB. napusdue to two recent duplication events. However, only 50BnPERKgenes were identified, suggesting a loss of duplicatedBnPERKgenes followingBrassicagenome triplication and hybridization. This indicated that gene loss was a crucial process during genomic arrangements and chromosome doubling . This also implied a selective process, where functionally redundantBnPERKcopies may have been lost, while the retained 50BnPERKgenes may be crucial for plant development, hormone signaling, and stress response.
Phylogenetic analysis revealed that mostAtPERKgenes corresponded to 2–6 orthologous genes inB. napus, each of which included orthologs from both the A and C subgenomes. However, someAtPERKgenes showed variations in the number of corresponding orthologous genes from the A and C subgenomes, suggesting extensive chromosomal rearrangements and asymmetric gene loss within duplicated genomic blocks . Analysis of Ka/Ks ratios of paralogous gene pairs indicated purifying selection on duplicatedBnPERKgenes, implying their functional conservation and evolutionary constraint at these loci .
Understanding the evolutionary dynamics of theBnPERKgene family not only enriches our knowledge of rapeseed genetics but also has broader implications for research in plant biology and stress-response mechanisms.
3.2. Exploring the Structural Diversity and Functional Roles of BnPERKs
TheBnPERKgene family exhibited significant structural diversity, including variations in gene length, molecular weight, and isoelectric points. These variations suggested potential functional specialization within the gene family .
Although functional studies ofBnPERKsare limited, expression profiling can still provide valuable insights about the gene’s function and its role in different biological processes . In accordance with the result inA. thaliana,BnPERKfamily members exhibited two distinct expression patterns: some were highly expressed in pollen, while others had broader expression patterns . Constitutive expression of certainBnPERKgenes indicated their essential roles in fundamental cellular functions, while someBnPERKsexhibited higher expression levels in floral organs, which is consistent with findings in other species likeA. thaliana,B. rapa,Triticum aestivum, andOryza sativaand indicates their importance in floral development [11,12,16,19]. Specifically, 18 orthologs ofAtPERK5,AtPERK6,AtPERK7,andAtPERK12were notably expressed in pollen, among whichAtPERK5andAtPERK12were shown to be essential for pollen tube growth [11,27]. Furthermore, certainB. rapagenes (orthologs ofAtPERK6andAtPERK12) were associated with male sterility, as they were downregulated in male-sterile mutants .BnPERK01A1andBnPERK01C1(orthologs ofAtPERK1) showed constitutively high expression, suggesting essential roles in fundamental cellular functions. Functional analysis ofBnPERK1indicated its role in regulating cell wall integrity, signaling in stress responses, and facilitating growth and development inArabidopsis.
Phylogenetic analysis indicated that theBnPERKgenes originated through segmental duplication . Structural examination confirmed the phylogenetic arrangement, with mostBnPERKgenes sharing conserved motifs and tyrosine kinase domains. Differences in gene structure andcis-acting regulatory elements in promoters suggested evolutionary divergence, which may contribute to functional diversity and evolutionary mechanisms . Analysis of thecis-element indicated thatBnPERKgenes were responsive to various stresses and hormone signaling pathways, with MeJA- and ABA-responsive elements being particularly abundant. This suggests thatBnPERKgenes could mediate diverse gene expression patterns and provide flexibility in stress responses .
Further study on the expression patterns ofBnPERKgenes in response to hormone treatments provided insights into their potential roles in hormone signaling and plant development. This rapid and robust response to IAA, ET, GA, CK, and BL suggested thatBnPERKgenes might play a crucial role in the early stages of hormonal signal transduction in leaves, possibly by mediating the downstream effects of these hormones. In contrast, the expression profiles in roots exhibited totally different expression patterns, which highlights the complexity and specificity of hormonal regulation in different tissues. Enhanced expression levels after GA and ABA treatments in roots suggest involvements in root growth and stress adaptation [31,32]. The contrasting expression patterns after MeJA treatment in roots and leaves imply distinct roles in different tissues. Additionally, the observation that genes such asBnPERK09A1,BnPERK09C1, andBnPERK04C1were induced in both leaves and roots after IAA treatment implies a role in auxin signaling, which is central to various developmental processes, including cell elongation and differentiation . These genes may act as intermediaries in auxin signal transduction pathways, influencing growth and development in a tissue-specific manner.
In summary, the comprehensive examination illuminates the structural diversity and functional implications of theBnPERKgene family. The differential expression patterns ofBnPERKgenes in response to various hormone treatments highlight their potential involvement in diverse physiological processes, including growth regulation, stress responses, and defense mechanisms.
3.3. Revealing the Role of BnPERK in Clubroot Disease
Recent studies have suggested that receptor-like kinases (RLKs) including PERKs are involved in plant–pathogen interactions and immune responses [2,3,4]. Analysis ofcis-elements and expression profiles suggested thatBnPERKsmay act as novel sensors for various stresses, particularly plant pathogen infections [5,12]. Protein–protein interaction network analysis supported this result, revealing the multifunctionality of BnPERK proteins and emphasizing their broad participation in plant physiological processes specific to plant disease response . The interactions involved cell wall organization, plant–pathogen interactions, plasma membrane dynamics, endomembrane activities, MAPK signaling pathways, and starch/sucrose metabolism. Given that pathogen-induced changes in cell walls affected disease resistance, it is possible thatBnPERKsdetect these alterations and initiate responses to maintain cell wall integrity . The membrane localization ofBnPERKssuggested they might perceive infection signals at the cell’s surface. Upon activation by cell wall components,BnPERKslikely trigger downstream signaling cascades, including MAPK pathways . Otherwise, MAPK pathways also acted as downstream signaling components of hormones and played important roles in plant responses to different stresses . Despite these insights, the exact role ofBnPERKsin plant immunity remains largely unknown, and their interactions with RLKs or coreceptors remain largely unexplored.
Clubroot disease, caused by the obligate parasiteP. brassicae, poses a significant threat to Brassicaceae plants . The parasite is dependent on plant-derived sugars as a carbon source for colonization [39,40]. The enriched sugar metabolism reflects the altered homeostasis and increased demand for sugar in infected plants. However, the downstream signaling components and their regulation in response toP. brassicaeinfection are not yet clear. ThePERKgene family, with its known functions in cell wall integrity and stress responses, may contribute to reinforcing the plant cell wall during pathogen infection or modulating defense-related signaling pathways . Given the role ofPERKsin disease response, the involvement of thePERKgene family inB. napusin clubroot disease was as expected. The transcriptional downregulation ofBnPERK09A1,BnPERK09C1,BnPERK14A1, andBnPERK06C2uponP. brassicaeinfection suggests their putative roles in clubroot disease response. In accordance with the result inB. napus, the expression ofAtPERK9was also downregulated in response toP. brassicae. Theperk9mutant was used for clubroot disease investigation, indicating the roles ofBnPERK09A1andBnPERK09C1in the disease resistance. Pathogenesis-related proteins including enzymes like β-1,3-glucanase (PR2) and thionins (PR5), which have antimicrobial activity and are involved in the basal immune response . TheRBOHD(Respiratory burst oxidase homolog D) gene is crucial in generating reactive oxygen species (ROS) as part of the plant immune system . The increased expression of these genes suggested that the knockout ofAtPERK9triggered the basal immune response, resulting in increased disease resistance inperk9.The induction ofPR2andRBOHDin both Col-0 andperk9after inoculation suggested that basal immune response occurred in susceptible Col-0. Furthermore, the induction ofBnPERK09A1andBnPERK09C1by IAA treatment was also particularly intriguing, as IAA is known to act as a signaling molecule potentially involved in the response toP. brassicaeinfection [43,44,45]. However, the exact roles ofBnPERK09A1andBnPERK09C1need further function study. The predicted interaction proteins associated with these pathways implied their roles in mediating the interaction betweenB. napusandP. brassicae, providing targets for further functional characterization.
In summary, uncovering the role ofBnPERKsin clubroot disease response provided valuable insights into plant–pathogen interactions and potential strategies for disease management.
4. Materials and Methods
4.1. Identification of BnPERK Genes in Brassica napus
TheBnPERKgene family was selected in this study due to its critical role in plant growth, development, and stress responses. It has not been extensively studied inB. napus, making it a valuable target for genome-wide analysis. The genomic data and annotation for theB. napuscultivar ‘ZS11’ were sourced fromB. napusmulti-omics information resource (BnIR) (https://yanglab.hzau.edu.cn/BnIR, accessed on 1 March 2024) . ThePERKgenes inB. napuswere identified using BLASTp (https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) with an E-value threshold of 10−5, employing the protein sequence of 15 AtPERKs as queries . TheBnPERKgene family members were named based on their orthologous relationships and chromosomal location. By searching the conserved domain in InterPro (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro, accessed on 5 March 2024) and the NCBI Conserved Domain Database (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Structure/cdd/wrpsb.cgi, accessed on 5 March 2024), the tyrosine kinase domain-containing protein sequences were verified for candidateBnPERKgenes. Additionally, Expasy (https://web.expasy.org/protparam, accessed on 8 March 2024) was utilized to assess the isoelectric points (pIs) and the molecular weights (MWs) of BnPERK proteins. Subcellular locations of these proteins were predicted using Euk-mPLoc  (http://www.csbio.sjtu.edu.cn/bioinf/euk-multi-2, accessed on8 March 2024).
4.2. Chromosomal Location, Gene Duplication, and Phylogenetic Analysis
The positions of theBnPERKgenes on the chromosomes were obtained from the annotation of theB. napusgenome. McScanX (https://www.rcac.purdue.edu/software/mcscanx) was employed to detect the duplication patterns, including segmental and tandem duplication . Visualization of chromosomal distribution and duplication events was represented using Circos (Vers. 0.69-9) software . The Ka/Ks (nonsynonymous substitution rate to synonymous substitution rate) ratio was calculated for the paralogous gene pairs using ParaAT2.0 . Collinearity analysis ofBnPERKgenes was conducted and displayed using TBtools (Vers. 2.056) . A phylogenetic tree was generated using MEGA 11  through neighbor-joining method with 1000 bootstrap replications and visualized using iTol (https://itol.embl.de, accessed on 11 March 2024).
4.3. Gene Structure, Conserved Motifs, and Cis-Elements Analysis
The exon–intron structure ofPERKgenes was examined using Gene Structure Display Server 2.0 (https://gsds.gao-lab.org/index.php/accessed on 14 March 2024). Conserved motifs were predicted using Multiple Expectation Maximization for Motif Elicitation (https://meme-suite.org/meme/tools/meme, accessed on 14 March 2024). The sequences of 2 Kb upstream from the start codon of 50BnPERKgenes were extracted from theB. napus‘ZS11’ genome and analyzed forcis-elements using PlantCARE  (http://bioinformatics.psb.ugent.be/webtools/plantcare/html, accessed on 14 March 2024) to predictcis-elements. The data were visualized using TBtools (Vers. 2.056) .
4.4. Expression Profiles of BnPERK Genes in Different Tissues and Under Hormone Treatments
To display different expression profiles, RNA-Seq data from various tissues and the hormone response ofB. napuscultivar ‘ZS11’ were obtained from BnIR. A total of 14 tissues at different development stages included seed, leaf, bud, root, petal, sepal, pollen, silique, filament, cotyledon, lower stem peel, middle stem peel, upper stem peel, and vegetative rosette stages. The roots and leaves were treated with hormones (IAA, auxin; ACC, l-aminocyclopropane-l-carboxylic acid; GA, gibberellin acid; ABA, abscisic acid; TZ, trans-zeatin; JA, methyl jasmonate; BL, brassinolide) and sampled at 0.5, 1, 3, and 6 h after treatment. Heatmaps were generated using these expression values after logarithmic transformed RPKM values and displayed using TBtools (Vers. 2.056) .
4.5. Network-Based Prediction of Protein Interactions
Analysis of the protein–protein interaction network inB. napuswas predicted using STRING (https://cn.string-db.org/, accessed on 15 March 2024), and the interactions were displayed using Cytoscape (Vers. 3.9.1) . In order to investigate the biological process involvingB. napusgenes, the putative interacted genes based on Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analyses were conducted by BnaOmics  (https://bnaomics.ocri-genomics.net/tools/enrich/, accessed on 15 March 2024).
4.6. Plasmodiophora Brassicae Inoculation, Clubroot Disease Investigation, and Histocytological Analysis
A collection ofPlasmodiophora brassicaeisolate from Zhijiang, Hubei, was used for inoculation in greenhouse. The seeds ofB. napuscultivar ‘ZS11’, wild-typeA. thaliana(Col-0), andAtPERK9mutant were germinated in a greenhouse maintained at 24 °C under a 16/8 h light/dark photoperiod. Seven-day-old rapeseed seedlings were inoculated with resting spores ofP. brassicaeat a concentration of 10−6spores/mL . Two-week-oldArabidopsisseedlings were inoculated at a concentration of 10−5spores/mL. The clubroot disease was investigated and photographed at 28–35 days after inoculation. The disease index was assessed using the following 0–3 scoring system: 0 refers to healthy roots; 1 refers to small galls on lateral roots only; 2 refers to small and medium galls covering the main root and a few lateral roots; 3 indicates large galls on the main root. The disease index (DI) was calculated according to the following formula: DI = 100 × (1 × N1+ 2 × N2+ 3 × N3)/3 × Nt. N1to N3refer to the number of plants in the indicated class, and Ntis the total number of plants tested.
The progression of cortex infection byP. brassicaewas studied. Approximately 0.5 cm long root segments were excised from the upper of the primary root. Following standard protocols for fixation and dehydration, the samples were embedded in paraffin and sectioned at a thickness of 5–8 μM. Sections were analyzed and photographed using an optical microscope.
4.7. Transcriptome Analysis of BnPERK Genes in B. napus During Clubroot Disease
Root samples ofB. napusinfected withP. brassicaeand uninfected controls were harvested at 14 days after treatment for RNA-Seq analysis. After sequencing and quality control, bioinformatics pipelines were using to clean raw sequencing data by removing adapters and low-quality reads. Then, the clean reads were aligned to the genome of ‘ZS11’. Gene expression levels were estimated using logarithmic transformed FPKM values. The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between infected and control samples were determined with the DEGseq2 (adjustedp< 0.05 and |log2(fold-change)| ≥ 1) and displayed using TBtools (Vers. 2.056).
4.8. qRT-PCR Analysis of Pathogenesis-Related (PR) Genes in A. thaliana
Root samples fromArabidopsisCol-0 andperk9infected withP. brassicaeand uninfected controls were harvested at 14 days after inoculation for qRT-PCR study. Total RNA was extracted from control and inoculated roots using the FastPure Universal Plant Total RNA Isolation Kit (Vazyme, Nanjing, China). First-strand cDNA was synthesized with HiScript IV RT SuperMix for qPCR (Vazyme). Gene-specific primers are listed inSupplementary Table S1.Actin2was used as reference gene. After running the qRT-PCR reactions, Ct (cycle threshold) values were obtained for each sample. The relative expression level was determined using the 2−ΔΔCtmethod . The data were presented as the mean ± standard error (SE) based on three technical replicates of three biological replicates. Significant difference was determined at ap-value < 0.05.
5. Conclusions
The study emphasized the evolutionary dynamics, structural diversity, and functional roles of theBnPERKgene family. It suggested thatBnPERKgenes are involved in various physiological processes, including growth regulation, stress responses, and the defense against pathogens. The transcriptional downregulation ofBnPERK09A1andBnPERK09C1uponP. brassicaeinfection and the potential involvement of these genes in clubroot disease response further emphasize their significance in plant immunity. The identification ofBnPERK09A1andBnPERK09C1as potential targets for disease management strategies and their putative role in signaling networks could contribute to the resistance improvement of Brassicaceae crops.
