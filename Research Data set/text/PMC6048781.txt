Root hairs are single-cell cylindrical projections that expand the effective radius of the root. In doing so, they play crucial roles in the uptake of water and nutrients from the soil, especially under conditions in which such resources are limiting (Carminati et al., 2017). Root hairs expand by tip growth, a process that involves the targeted delivery and secretion of vesicles to the cell apex. As a result, root hairs attain lengths that are several times their widths (Chebli et al., 2013). In tip-growing cells, cargo transported by tip-targeted vesicles consist of an assortment of carbohydrate precursors that are needed for the assembly and remodeling of the apical cell wall (Gu and Nielsen, 2013). Research spanning several decades has led to the identification of multiple components of the tip growth machinery including protein modulators of cytoskeletal organization, membrane trafficking, cytoplasmic calcium ([Ca2+]cyt) signaling, and phosphoinositide metabolism (Cole and Fowler, 2006;Rounds and Bezanilla, 2013).
In recent years, plant malectin-like receptor kinases, also known asCatharanthus roseusreceptor-like kinases (CrRLK1Ls;Franck et al., 2018), have been shown to regulate tip growth in root hairs and pollen tubes (Duan et al., 2010;Bai et al., 2014;Haruta et al., 2014;Ge et al., 2017;Schoenaers et al., 2018). In one noteworthy study,Bai et al. (2014)reported that a CrRLK1L, which they named [Ca2+]cyt-associated protein kinase 1 (CAP1), modulates root hair growth by maintaining ammonium (NH4+) homeostasis. CAP1 is also known as ERULUS (ERU), named after the son of FERONIA (FER), a widely studied member of the CrRLK1L family (Haruta et al., 2014). InArabidopsis thaliana,cap1/eruloss-of-function mutants have short and irregularly shaped root hairs consistent with a role of CAP1/ERU as a positive regulator of root hair growth (Bai et al., 2014;Haruta et al., 2014;Schoenaers et al., 2018).Bai et al. (2014)proposed a model wherein CAP1/ERU functions in maintaining root hair growth under high NH4+environments by sensing cytoplasmic NH4+. Sensing of cytoplasmic NH4+by CAP1/ERU then triggers signaling events that lead to NH4+sequestration into the vacuole, making it less toxic to the cell. The model postulates that toxic levels of NH4+accumulate in the cytoplasm ofcap1/eruloss-of-function mutants, resulting in the disappearance of tip-focused [Ca2+]cytgradients, and because of this lack of tip-focused [Ca2+]cytgradients, their root hairs cease to expand (Bai et al., 2014). In this letter, we question the proposed role of CAP1/ERU in NH4+homeostasis based on our studies of a neweru-3mutant allele, showing that CAP1/ERU is instead localized to the plasma membrane (PM) and its function is linked to tip-focused [Ca2+]cytoscillations. This is further supported by recent work on theeru-2mutant bySchoenaers et al. (2018), as described below.
CAP1/ERU IS A PM-LOCALIZED PROTEIN
A major result used to support the CAP1/ERU-NH4+homeostasis model was the observation that a CAP1/ERU-GFP fusion localized to the tonoplast. According to the model, the tonoplast-localized CAP1/ERU is what senses cytoplasmic NH4+, resulting in its compartmentalization into the vacuole (Bai et al., 2014).
We independently isolated the recessiveeru-3mutant in a forward-genetic screen for root hair mutants that resembled wild-type root hairs treated with low concentrations of the actin-disrupting compound latrunculin B. Here, we refer to our mutant aseru-3following the nomenclature ofHaruta et al. (2014), in which two mutant alleles oferuwere first described aseru-1anderu-2. Thecap1mutant (SALK_083442) studied byBai et al. (2014)is similar toeru-2; therefore, we refer to it here ascap1/eru-2(Figure 1A). When we expressed anERU-GFPconstruct under the control of the constitutiveUBIQUITIN10(UBQ10) promoter (UBQ10:ERU-GFP) in theeru-3mutants, their root hairs were restored to wild-type lengths, indicating that the fusion protein was functional (Figures 1B and 1C).

We found that instead of localizing to the root hair tonoplast, ERU-GFP marked the PM at the site of root hair bulges. As root hairs transitioned to rapid tip growth, the ERU-GFP signal intensified and formed a diffuse fluorescent cap at the root hair apex (Figure 1D). Distal to the root hair tip, ERU-GFP decorated distinct and dynamic puncta that were reminiscent of post-Golgi and endocytic vesicles (Figure 1D). As root hairs matured and ceased growth, the intensity of ERU-GFP at the tip declined (Figure 1D). Time-course and correlation analyses revealed that tip-directed accumulation of ERU-GFP was most intense in root hairs that grew rapidly (Figures 1E and 1F), supporting the role of ERU as a positive regulator of root hair tip growth.
It is important to note thatBai et al. (2014)used transient expression of a CAP1/ERU-GFP fusion in protoplasts and onion epidermal cells to conclude that it localized to the tonoplast, and the functionality of their CAP1/ERU-GFP construct was not validated in root hairs. It is possible that their CAP1/ERU-GFP was mislocalized because it was expressed in cell types (i.e., leaf protoplasts and onion epidermal cells) in which ERU is not typically found. We attempted to express ERU-GFP in theeru-3mutant under the control of the nativeERUpromoter (ERUpro) consisting of 626 bp upstream of theERUgene. Unfortunately, we were unable to recoverERUpro:ERU-GFPlines. However, it was recently reported that a 2529-bp sequence that included theERUpromoter coupled to theERUcoding andGFPsequence (ERUp:ERU-GFP) complementedcap1/eru-2root hairs (Schoenaers et al., 2018). This group found that expressed ERU-GFP localized to root hairs in a similar manner as our constitutively expressed ERU-GFP, further supporting our conclusion that the PM is where the ERU protein resides.
CAP1/ERU FUNCTION IS LINKED TO CYTOPLASMIC CALCIUM OSCILLATIONS
Another major result ofBai et al. (2014)that we address in this letter is their finding that root hairs ofcap1/eruloss-of-function mutants appeared to lack tip-focused [Ca2+]cytgradients. We feel that it is important to address these results because they provide an example of how [Ca2+]cytimaging data on root hairs can be misinterpreted. For these experiments, it is critical to note that root hair growth ceases when the large central vacuole protrudes toward the cell apex (Grierson et al., 2014). Furthermore, mature, nongrowing root hairs in which the vacuole protrudes to the apex have been shown to lack [Ca2+]cytgradients (Wymer et al., 1997). The images ofcap1/eru-2root hairs thatBai et al. (2014)presented as the basis for extracting their [Ca2+]cytdata (Figures 2A and 3C inBai et al. ) clearly showed the vacuole protruding to the apex. Based on the above observations, we would not expect to find [Ca2+]cytgradients in such root hairs. We expressed the intensiometric [Ca2+]cytreporter G-CAMP3 (Tian et al., 2009) ineru-3to assess if their root hairs lacked a [Ca2+]cytgradient. We were careful to sample [Ca2+]cytonly in root hairs that had a dense cytoplasm at the cell apex.
In contrast to the results ofBai et al. (2014), we found thateru-3root hairs that still had a substantial cytoplasm at the apex did not lack tip-focused [Ca2+]cytgradients. Theseeru-3root hairs were still elongating, albeit at a significantly reduced rate when compared with the wild type (∼0.20 μm/min foreru-3versus 1 μm/min for the wild type). However, we did observe that patterns of tip [Ca2+]cytoscillations in these slow growingeru-3root hairs were compromised. Compared with the wild type, root hairs oferu-3had more prolonged periods of elevated tip-focused [Ca2+]cytfollowed by longer periods of dampened [Ca2+]cyt(Figures 2A to 2C;Supplemental Movie 1). Quantitative analysis of [Ca2+]cytfollowing the fast Fourier transform methods described bySchoenaers et al. (2018)showed thateru-3displayed low frequency [Ca2+]cytoscillations. The main frequency of [Ca2+]cytoscillations ineru-3root hairs was 0.003 ± 0.0002 Hz compared with 0.044 ± 0.0184 Hz in the wild type (Figure 2D). Furthermore, the amplitude of [Ca2+]cytoscillation at the tips oferu-3was ∼3-fold higher than the wild type (Figure 2E). These results are in agreement with findings ofSchoenaers et al. (2018)in which they showed decreased frequency and increased amplitude of pectin Ca2+binding site oscillations incap1/eru-2root hairs. It is clear from our results that ERU is important for normal tip-focused [Ca2+]cytoscillations, a process that is crucial for sustained root hair growth (Monshausen et al., 2008). Mechanistic links between PM-localized ERU and the maintenance of [Ca2+]cytoscillations are unknown. However, demonstrating the true nature of tip-focused [Ca2+]cytdefects ineru-3root hairs enables the development of more accurate models that could be tested in the future to explain how ERU modulates tip growth.

In light of the ERU localization data presented here and those reported bySchoenaers et al. (2018), the model byBai et al. (2014), proposing that tonoplast-based NH4+signaling is the major driver for ERU-mediated tip-focused [Ca2+]cytoscillations and root hair growth, needs reexamination. Other CrRLK1Ls, such as FER, THESEUS1, HERCULES1, ANXUR, and BUDDHA’s PAPER SEAL, have all been shown to localize to the PM (Escobar-Restrepo et al., 2007;Hématy et al., 2007;Boisson-Dernier et al., 2009;Guo et al., 2009;Miyazaki et al., 2009;Duan et al., 2010;Ge et al., 2017). Our results and those ofSchoenaers et al. (2018)clearly demonstrate that ERU is also a PM-localized CrRLK1L and should no longer be referred to as a vacuolar membrane-localized protein.
